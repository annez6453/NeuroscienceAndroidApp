#Neuroscience Efficient Coding App

##Key Contributers: Carlee Bettler, Laryssa Seabra, Diego Tavares, Anne Zhao 

###Key Concepts

• Our brain uses efficient coding, processing sensory information with the least amount of electrical impulses possible

    o Optimized to process natural stimuli 
    
        • i.e. images and sounds from nature
        
    o Type of sparse coding

        • Akin to sparse matrix structure; Lots of 0s, minimum 1s

• Neural efficient coding can (incredibly!) be replicated with statistical algorithms

    o Specifically, uses ICA (independent component analysis) to analyze images 
  
•	Hones in on important information (cocktail party effect)

•	Does not just resize info!

•	Creates tiling of visual filters 

•	Resemble Gabor-filter like response properties of eye cells 

    o A. Original natural image

    o B. Random samples from original

    o C. Filters from ICA

    o D. Experimentally measured visual neural filters

        • Gabor-like filters

###Our Goal: Create an app for neuroscience students that illustrates the concepts (i.e. straight-forwardness) of efficient coding algorithms.  

###Main Steps:

• Translate code written in Python by Ann Zhao into Java

• Create an Android app in Java

• Test app and expand features

     o Add own photos
     
     o Process auditory info
