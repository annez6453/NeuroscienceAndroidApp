    <string name="slide_1_desc">Efficient coding is a term from Neuroscience that refers to the process that the brain does in order to transmit sensory information with the minimum amount of neurons firing as possible.</string>
    <string name="slide_2_title">Natural Images and Sounds</string>
    <string name="slide_2_desc">Our brains have evolved to use efficient coding algorithms specifically to process natural images and sounds, which include animal vocalizations, environmental sounds and human speech.</string>

    <string name="slide_3_title">Receptive Field Filters</string>
    <string name="slide_3_desc">Efficient coding can be experimentally measured and displayed via images and waves called receptive field filters.</string>

    <string name="slide_4_desc">Using this app, you can see the receptive field filters associated to predefined images and sounds that look the same to the ones that can be seen in your brain!</string>
