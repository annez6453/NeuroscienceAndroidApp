    <string name="slide_2_title">What is Efficient Coding?</string>
    <string name="slide_2_desc">Efficient coding is the process that the brain does in order to transmit sensory information with the minimum amount of neurons firing as possible.</string>
    <string name="slide_1_title">Natural Images and Sounds</string>
    <string name="slide_1_desc">Our brains have evolved to use efficient coding algorithms specifically to process natural images and sounds, like animal vocalizations, environmental sounds and human speech.</string>

    <string name="slide_3_title">How does Efficient Coding works?</string>
    <string name="slide_3_desc">Everytime you see an image, or hear a sound, your brain will activate some neurons, creating qhat are called receptive field filters.</string>

    <string name="slide_4_title">Why an App?</string>
    <string name="slide_4_desc">Now you can see the receptive field filters associated to predefined images and sounds that look the same to the ones that can be seen in your brain!</string>
